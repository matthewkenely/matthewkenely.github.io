            </h1>

            <p class="info">
                Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor Konrad Adenauer. The
                first
                German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the
                Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway
                ring
                road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (Stadtautobahn) was planned, but only partially put
                into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became Bundesstraße
                ("Federal
                Road") B 55a, which begins at the Zoobrücke ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with A 4 and A 3 at the interchange
                Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as Stadtautobahn by most locals. In contrast to this, the
                Nord-Süd-Fahrt ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre
                through-route,
                which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section
                south
                of Ebertplatz was completed in 1972. In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North
                Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn 3, part of the eastern section of the Cologne
                Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

            <p class="info">
                Compared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very bicycle-friendly. It has
                repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation[77] conducted by the Allgemeiner
                Deutscher
                Fahrrad-Club. In 2014 it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.

            <p class="info">
                Cologne has a railway service with Deutsche Bahn InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at Köln Hauptbahnhof
                (Cologne Main Station), Köln Messe/Deutz and Cologne/Bonn Airport. ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains
                link
                Cologne with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day).
                There
                are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Berlin. ICE Trains to
                London
                via the Channel Tunnel were planned for 2013.[78]

                The Cologne Stadtbahn operated by Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB)[79] is an extensive light rail system
                that
                is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the
                tram
                system. Nearby Bonn is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional
                recreational boats on the Rhine. Düsseldorf is also linked by S-Bahn trains, which are operated by
                Deutsche
                Bahn.

                The Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn has 5 lines which cross Cologne.The S13/S19 runs 24/7 between Cologne Hbf and
                Cologne/Bonn airport.

                There are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and Eurolines coaches
                to
                London via Brussels.
